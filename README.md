# Decision-Tree---Python
A simple Decision Tree program developed in Python

**How does it work?**
Based on the Gini Index and the Information Gain indices, this software builds a decision tree that predicts an outcome baesd on several predictors. Upon launch, the user is prompted to enter several variables that will influence the result (maximum tree depth, training set size, and so on).
The software also prints out useful metrics that will help measure the effectiveness of the model, such as accuracy and recall.
